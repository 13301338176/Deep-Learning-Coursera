# Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Projects from the first course of the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), Neural NEtworks and Deep Learning from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) offered by Coursera.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The Code inside the nptebooks is written in Python 3.6.5 . If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. 

To install pip run in the command Line
```
python -m ensurepip -- default-pip
``` 
to upgrade it 
```
python -m pip install -- upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```
to upgrade Python
```
pip install python -- upgrade
```

You will also need to download the Numpy, sklearn and MatplotLib packages. Again in the command Line type
```
pip install numpy sklearn Matplotlib


```
to download them using pip or

```
conda install numpy sklearn matplotlib 

```
and type Yes when asked to to download them using Anaconda.


### Viewing the Jupyter Notebook

In order to better view and work on the jupyter Notebook I encourage you to use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) . You can simply copy and paste the link to this website and you will be able to edit it without any problem. Alternatively you can clone the repository using 
```
git clone https://github.com/fotisk07/Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning/
```
then in the command Line type, after you have downloaded jupyter notebook type
```
jyputer notebook
```
locate the notebook and run it.
